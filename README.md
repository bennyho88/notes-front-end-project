# notes-front-end-project

This project is related with the previous project were we had to use php for learning the back-end. Therefore is this new project more focused on the front-end where we will learn to use one of the 3 framworks that are recommended which is React, Angual or Vue.js and to built or first full stack project.



Sprint 0: Introduction

Look up for more information regarding the framworks and choose one for making the project.

- React:

	Pros:

		-Biggest community and code owned and maintained by Facebook.
		-Big ecosystem
		-Flexibility
		-Scalable
		-Can be used for native and web apps
		-Medium learning curve
		-Fast rendering with Virtual-DOM

	Cons:

		-Requires to learn JSX and is more programmer-oriented.
		-It’s kind of verbose. Writing components isn’t as straight forward as pure HTML & JS
		-Being too flexible in structure can be problematic
		-Community conventions are still developing. So far there is no defined methodology on how to implement React.
		-In React, everything is just JavaScript
		-Legacy code from the current Angular 1.5 needs a total rewrite in JSX
	




- Angular

	Pros: 
		- Big community and code owned and maintained by Google.
		- Typescript and intelisense.
		- Existing community conventions. Defined implementation methodology.
		- Is a MVC framework.
		- Reusing the legacy code from the current Angular 1.5 app will be faster.


	Cons:

		- Steep learning curve.
		- Is verbose and complex.
		- Requires learning Typescript and is more programmer-oriented.



- Vue.js

	Pros:

		-Backed by Laravel and Alibaba. Big players are starting to adopt the framework.
		-Simplicity of the syntax and short learning curve for newcomers
		-Uncomplicated structure
		-Features a lot of concepts from Angular 1 and React
		-Flexibility. Can be easily setup with Typescript, JSX, …
		-Fast rendering with Virtual-DOM

	Cons:

		- Owned by one person, maintained by a small team. 
		- Being too flexible in structure can be problematic
		- Legacy code from the current Angular 1.5 will need some convertion.


Conclusion:

The framework I opted is React. It is a great framework for beginners where the learning curve is medium and can be both used for native and web apps. Moreover, it has a big community which means that the documentation is quite complete and easier for finding solutions.
